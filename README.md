# Solutions to the Questions of "Teach Yourself C" By Herbert Schildt
<br/>

## In this repository you will find all the solutions that I have written for the questions in this book.<br/>
<br/>

I will not write any question here believing you have the book. So, check the question by yourself. Answer to the theory questions are written in "README.md" file in each folder for the chapter. The programs are written as well. For the question that have code, I have written "Check the book", as I do not have any intention to write the code in the questions.
